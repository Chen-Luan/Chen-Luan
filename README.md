### 你好呀

何以为星，何以为辰？天地方寸，芸芸众生。

业余游戏制作人兼游戏策划兼翻译员。

I am an English-to-Chinese translator out of personal interest.

Are you looking for Chinese translation for your project? Feel free to [contact me](http://chenluan.mikecrm.com/zzGlas5)!

- I specialize in translating software and games from English to Simplified Chinese. I particularly excel in providing elegant translations for short sentences rather than lengthy content.

- I typically provide translated files in .json or similar formats. I am happy to provide free translation services for open-source or newly established projects. I use this work to promote myself, so my services are generally free. For larger translation volumes, you might consider offering a small tip.

- My translation work is licensed under the CC0 license, which means you are free to use, modify, or adapt it for any purpose, including commercial use, without any restrictions!

My translation contributions history:

- [AgriCraft](https://github.com/AgriCraft/AgriCraft/pull/1497/files)

- [bloop](https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop/pull/1262/files)
