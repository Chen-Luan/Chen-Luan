### 你好呀

何以为星，何以为辰？天地方寸，芸芸众生。

业余游戏制作人兼游戏策划兼翻译员。

I am an English-to-Chinese translator out of personal interest.

Are you looking for Chinese translation for your project? Feel free to [contact me](http://chenluan.mikecrm.com/zzGlas5)!

- I specialize in translating software and games from English to Simplified Chinese. I particularly excel in providing elegant translations for short sentences rather than lengthy content.

- I typically provide translated files in .json or similar formats. I am happy to provide free translation services for open-source or newly established projects. I use this work to promote myself, so my services are generally free. For larger translation volumes, you might consider offering a small tip.

My translation contributions history:

- [AgriCraft](https://github.com/AgriCraft/AgriCraft/pull/1497/files)

- [bloop](https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop/pull/1262/files)

- [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/18296/files#diff-015c2cbfb9f27443f0b3e0b9af98cd459b0ba2358d8c4504fb3c91f9fc5d4a8e)
